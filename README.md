1. The `elevator outage` folder contains `notebook.ipynb`, which is Radhika's regression with census variables.
2. `foil_data` > `eda.iphnb` is Sabina's regression with foil data. 
To run `eda.iphnb` you will need to download `2023_subway_censusvar_multire.csv`, which is accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uZcIPkzq6sTAGxfVR--rEgShWm6Izdwq?usp=drive_link) in the `processed_data` folder.
