# MTA elevator outages

#### Subway elevator outages have been hurting disabled people's ability to commute in NYC
##### We analyzed publicly available [MTA elevator availability data](https://metrics.mta.info/?subway/elevatorescalatoravailability) and Liftnet data

## Part 1: Regression modeling for elevator outages

### Step 1: Connect to Census to add census variables

### Step 2: Add other requires variables: station ridership, number of routes at station level, and whether a station is a major interchange.

### Step 3: Run regression models 


## Part 2: FOIL data




 
1. The `elevator outage` folder contains `notebook.ipynb`, which is Radhika's regression with census variables.
2. `foil_data` > `eda.iphnb` is Sabina's regression with foil data. 
To run `eda.iphnb` you will need to download `2023_subway_censusvar_multire.csv`, which is accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uZcIPkzq6sTAGxfVR--rEgShWm6Izdwq?usp=drive_link) in the `processed_data` folder.
